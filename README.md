# BCPOW-RUST
BCPOW is a blockchain that uses a proof of work consensus algorithm. The objective is for anyone to be able to learn how blockchain works by reading code.
This project is for educational purpose only, and should not be used on a real network.
There is only a dev branch for now as the project is still under development. 
A fully working version should be expected around mid February.
